# Machine learning {#four}

This week you will learn about machine learning for classification using _R_. Objectives are:

- To provide an overview of the underlying concepts of
machine learning for classification.

- To provide an introduction to some popular
classification algorithms.

- To explore these classification algorithms using various packages in _R_.

- To choose a classification algorithm and apply it to the statewide COVID-19 dataset.

## Day 22 (Monday) Zoom check-in

Here is an overview of what we'll cover in today's Zoom session:

- Overview of Machine Learning for Classification (10 minutes)

- Introduction to the Random Forests algorithm (10 minutes)

- A Random Forests Example in _R_ using Radiomics Data (25 minutes)

## Day 23

For today's independent work you will learn about the Support Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and apply it to the radiomics data that you worked with on Monday.

## Day 24

For today's independent work you will learn about the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and apply it to the radiomics data.

## Day 25

For today's independent work you will learn about artificial neural networks (ANN). You will attempt to add Keras and TensorFlow support to your R/RStudio installation. If this turns out to be too dofficult, you will learn some "remote computing" alternatives that you can use in lieu of a local _R/Kera/TensorFlow_ installation. Finally, you'll apply `R-Keras-TensorFlow` to the radiomics example that you've been working with during the week.
