# Frequently asked questions {-}

1. Is the course material available in PDF?

   Yes, click the 'Download' icon and PDF format in the title bar of the main document, as illustrated in the  figure.

   Remember that the course material is a 'work in progress', so the PDF will need to be updated frequently throughout the course. Also, the book is not pretty; that's a task for a separate quarantine!
