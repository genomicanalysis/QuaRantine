This course was suggested and enabled by Adam Kisailus and Richard Hershberger. It is available for Roswell Park graduate students. Introduction The word ‘quarantine’ is from the 1660’s and refers to the fourty days (Italian quaranta giorni) a ship suspected of carrying disease was kept in isolation. What to do in a quarantine? The astronaut Scott Kelly spent nearly a year on the International Space Station. In a New York Times opinion piece he says, among other things, that ‘you need a hobby’, and what better hobby than a useful one? Let’s take the opportunity provided by COVID-19 to learn R for statistical analysis and comprehension of data. Who knows, it may be useful after all this is over! What to expect We’ll meet via zoom twice a week, Mondays and Thursdays, for one hour. We’ll use this time to make sure everyone is making progress, and to introduce new or more difficult topics. Other days we’ll have short exercises and activities that hopefully provide an opportunity to learn at your own speed. We haven’t thought this through much, but roughly we might cover: Week 1: In Chapter we’ll start with the basics of installing and using R. We’ll set up R and RStudio on your local computer, or if that doesn’t work use a cloud-based RStudio. We’ll learn the basics of R – numeric, character, factor, and other vectors; variables; the data.frame; saving and reading data; basic data manipulation and visualization. Week 2: Packages for extending R. A great strenght of R is its extensibility through packages. We’ll learn about CRAN, and install and use the ‘tidyverse’ suite of packages. We’ll use publicly available data to explore the spread of COVID-19 in the US, including data manipulation and visualization. Week 3: Bioinformatic analysis with Bioconductor. Bioconductor is a collection of more than 1800 R packages for the statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. We’ll use Bioconductor to look at COVID-19 genome sequences, and to explore emerging genomic data relevant to the virus. Week 4: Independent projects. This week we’ll get introspective, developing an analysis of data interesting to ourselves. We’ll learn about writing ‘markdown’ reports to share our project with others. Week 5: Group projects. COVID-19 has really shown the value of open data and collaboration, so we’ll tackle a group project where we each contribute to overall insights. We’ll learn tools of collaboration including git and github, and develop ‘best practices’ for robust, reproducible research. Week 6: Sharing and end of QuaRantine! 40 days is 5 weeks and 5 days, so we should be wrapping up our ‘hobby’ in week 6. Let’s summarize what we’ve done, and chart a path forward as we return to civilization! "],
