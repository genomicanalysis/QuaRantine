Enter a Title and your name as Author Use HTML as default output RStudio creates a template Save it (e.g., click the floppy disk icon) in the Week-06 folder Preview (knit) the markdown template Click the knit button Install the knitr package if button is missing Customize the template Let’s add a demonstration of ggplot2 using the mtcars data set: --- title: \"multiple regression plots\" author: \"Shawn Matott\" date: \"5/13/2020\" output: html_document --- ## Muliple Regression Plots - Scatterplot by category with regression lines (using ggplot2) ```{r} library(ggplot2) data(\"mtcars\") # convert cyl to a factor-level object mtcars % mutate( cyl = factor( cyl, levels = c(4, 6, 8), labels = c(\"4 cyl\", \"6 cyl\", \"8 cyl\") ) ) ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color=cyl))+ geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")+ labs(title=\"Regression of MPG on Weight by # Cylinders\", x = \"Weight\", y = \"Miles per Gallon\", color = \"Cylinders\") ``` Preview your edits Save your changes Click the knit button After a bit of processing, the Rmarkdown is rendered as an .html page. Notice how the R code block has been evaluated and resulting console output and plot are included in the .html. This is great because we can be sure that the vignette is actually working (e.g. no syntax errors or other coding problems). There’s a related package called bookdown that allows you to assemble documents and publish them directly to the web for all to see! 6.1.3 Writing and documenting R functions (25 minutes) 6.2 4 Days Write a vignette! 6.3 3 Days Create documented, reusable functions! 6.4 2 Days Share your work as a package! 6.5 Today!
