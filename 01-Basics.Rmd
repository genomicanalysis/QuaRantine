What is R?

```{r echo = FALSE}

```

analysis and scientific graphics.

What is [RStudio][]?

[RStudio]: https://rstudio.com/

- RStudio provides an integrated editor and shell environment to make R programming easier. Some of the more useful features include:
    - Syntax highlighting and color coding
    - Easy switching between shell and editor
    - Dynamic help and docs
    
- Two ways to "get" RStudio:
    - Install on your laptop or desktop
        - Download the free desktop [installer here][]
    - Use the rstudio.cloud resource
        - [Visit rstudio.cloud][], sign-up, and sign-on

[installer here]:  https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

[Visit rstudio.cloud]: https://rstudio.cloud/

- The preferred approach for this course is to try to install R and RStudio on your own computer
  - Windows Users:
    - [Download R for Windows][] and run the installer. Avoid, if possible, installing as administrator.
    - [Download RStudio for Windows][] and run the installer.
    - Test the installation by launching RStudio. You should end up with a window like the screen shot below.
  - Mac Users:
    - [Download R for macOS][] (OS X 10.11, El Capitan, and later) or [older macOS][] and run the installer.
    - [Download RStudio for macOS][] and run the installer.
    - Test the installation by launching RStudio. You should end up with a window like the screen shot below.

[Download R for Windows]: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-3.6.3-win.exe

[Download Rstudio for Windows]: https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-1.2.5033.exe

[Download R for macOS]: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/R-3.6.3.pkg

[older macOS]: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/R-3.6.3.nn.pkg

[Download Rstudio for macOS]: https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/macos/RStudio-1.2.5033.dmg 

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/RStudio-screenshot.png')
```

ALTERNATIVE OPTION;

- Do the following only if you are NOT ABLE TO INSTALL R and RStudio:
- Visit [rstudio.cloud][]. Click the 'Get Started' button, and create an account (I used my gmail account...). You should end up at a screen like the following.

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/RStudio-cloud-screenshot.png')
```

- Click on the 'New Project' button, to end up with a screen like the one below. Note the 'Untitled Project' at the top of the screen; click on it to name your project, e.g., 'QuaRantine'.

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/RStudio-cloud-project.png')
```

## Breakout Room
At this point you should have RStudio running either via your desktop installation or through rstudio.cloud. If not, please let use know via the chat window and we'll invite you to a breakout room to troubleshoot your installation.
